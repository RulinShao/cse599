# Paper reflections

**Reflections are due by 11:59pm the day before each class.**

All students are expected to read the assigned papers before class. After reading the papers, submit a single doc on Gradescope with their responses to the following questions for each paper:
1. What was the central claim of the paper?
2. What did you find convincing about the paper?
3. What did you find less convincing, and what did you wish the authors did instead?
4. What is one surprising thing that you learned from this paper?
5. What’s one follow-up idea related to this paper that you’d find interesting to work on?

Answer these questions separately for each paper. Responses should be clear and concise (~1-3 sentences per question per paper), but they can be informal; these will be graded on a pass/fail basis. All submissions must be typeset.

No paper is perfect, but all papers contain ideas that we can learn from. Be skeptical but also open-minded about the claims in each paper. Your responses will be kept private and only seen by the course staff, so you may be candid (but professional).

**Generative AI policy.** You may not use generative AI tools in any way to write your paper reflections.
